Develop a PWA style app that can be wrapped and installed as ios app and android app.
Basic features, 
* google-login.
* Users should default to "Borrower" mode. They can switch to "Lender" mode with a click of a button.
* The UI should be different for "Borrower" mode and "Lender" mode.

"Borrower" mode,
* Borrowing user should be able to search and match tools listed only in nearby locations (give 5/10/20 mile radius options).

"Lender" mode,
* Lending user should be able to take a snapshot of the tool and create a listing using their phone.
* Listings should be persistent (saved in aws?)
* Be able to DM another user. Other users should get notification.
* There should be a dedicated chat window where two users can talk.
* There should be a notification icon indicating any unread notifications.



Future features,
Connect your phone number so that Borrower can reach you easily. 
As this is primarily being developed for Deerbrooke community, there should be an option to reach out on WhatsApp.


Since, we can use AI heavily, we can go with TestDrivenDevelopment style for easy testing.
