I am developing a Tool Rental App that which is basically a marketplace for tool rentals. This is focused on smaller groups (ex. people living in the same community). The main idea is that people are more willing to lend/share their tools to people that are living in the community.

Anyone can create a community (with a unique name. Think subreddit). Once a community is created, anyone can join that community.

A user can be a part of one or more communities or just be alone. By default, any lender-user who lists their items are listed in all the communities they have joined.
Similarly, a borrower-user is able to see all the tool listings that are part of the community they are in.

Any lender-user has an option to limit their tool listing visiblility only to communities they are a part of (this is the default option). They have the option to make the tool listing public that way anyone irrespective of whether they are a part of community or not will be able to see the listings.

Develop a PWA style app that can be wrapped and installed as ios app and android app.

Basic features, 
* google-login.
* Users should default to "Borrower" mode. They can switch to "Lender" mode with a click of a button.
* The UI should be different for "Borrower" mode and "Lender" mode.

"Borrower" mode,
* Borrowing user should be able to search and match tools listed only in nearby locations (give 5/10/20 mile radius options).

"Lender" mode,
* Lending user should be able to take a snapshot of the tool and create a listing using their phone.
* Listings should be persistent (saved in aws?)
* User should be able to block the availability of the tools with a calendar.

Common features for both modes,
* Be able to DM another user. Other users should get notification.
* There should be a dedicated chat window where two users can talk.
* There should be a notification icon indicating any unread notifications.


Future features,
Connect your phone number so that Borrower can reach you easily. 
As this is primarily being developed for Deerbrooke community, there should be an option to reach out on WhatsApp.



Since, we can use AI heavily, we can go with TestDrivenDevelopment style for easy testing.
